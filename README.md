# SRC-ERS Patcher

Synthesis patcher for [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396), specifically the [exclude from radiant system](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41881) add-on. The patcher forwards the formlist condition that ERS adds to radiant quests to ensure subsequent quests are not assigned to a cleared location. This patcher is intended to allow SRC to work alongside quest mods such as [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) and [Quests are in Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18416), which also edit radiant quests, without having to make complex combination patches manually for all affected quests.

Run this patcher in the same group as other patchers that also modify quests.
